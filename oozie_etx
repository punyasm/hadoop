I finally solved it by installing a third-party version of ExtJS from the following url: http://archive.cloudera.com/gplextras/misc/ext-2.2.zip

Then following the steps:

Stop Oozie service from Ambari
Copy it to the path:
/usr/hdp/current/oozie-client/libext/

Regenerate the war file by executing:
$ /usr/hdp/current/oozie-server/bin/oozie-setup.sh prepare-war

Start Oozie again
